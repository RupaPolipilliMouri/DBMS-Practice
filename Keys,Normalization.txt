
Normalization in DBMS
=====================
set of rules to prevent data redundancy

It is defined as process to remove to remove/redundant data among diff tables to ensure data integrity
which supplies the CRUD(Create,Read,update and delete)
it removes anamolies like
   insert anamoly
   update anamoly
   delete anamoly


keys in DBMS
=============

A key is an attribute or set of attributes that help to uniquely identify a row/tuple in a relation/table.

keys are used to establish relationship/association between tables

Why keys are required?
========================
for in defining various integrity constrains


types of keys
===========
1ary key  table level constraint
candidate 
super
foriegn   table level
composite
alternate
unique

1.Primarykey:  
=============

1 table have only 1 primary key
Primary key values cannot be not null
Primary key values must be unique

Primary key= not null+value(unique)



2 types of constrains:
====================
column level
table level
                                       Primarykey syntax
                                        ====================

create table employee(empid varchar(10),empname varchar(50),empdob date,empemail varchar(30),primary key(empid));


alter table employee add primarykey(empid)

        Adding primary key with name
=================================

create table project(projectid varchar(18),projectname varchar(30),constraint project_pk primary key(projectid));


Drop the primary key
===================
alter table project drop primary key;


alter table project drop constraint project_pk;

2.Candidate key
=============
group of keys

priary key is a candidate key
Candidate key are those Attributes that uniquely identify rows of the table
more than on attribue can be candidate keys
candidate keys is super key with no repeated attributes
example:
========
employeeid,employeeemail,employeemobileno etc,,

3.Superkey
============
set of keys thar are uniquely identify other columns of that table
The primary key is picked from superkey
A superkey can



4. Foreign key
=============
Foreign keys are the column of the table which is used to point to the primary key of another table
