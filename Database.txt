EDL=          extraction,transformation,loading
ELT =   it is the process which can directly load the data


Types of databases and models:
NO sql
sql



database?

organized collection of interrelated data stored in a server/computer.

ACID Properties:
===============
ATOMICITY
CONSISTENCY
ISOLATION
DURA

imp of DB
============

FOr handling large amount of diff types of data with ease.
systamatically we cam retreive ,filter and sort and update data efficiently and accurately.


types of DB Model:
==================
flat model and flat file


DBs
===========
Hierarrchical           db and model
network model      db and model
relational model   db and model
Dimensional model it is model not db
object oriented       db and model


RELATIONSHIPS:
================
ONE TO ONE
ONE TO MANY
MANY TO ONE
MANY TO MANY

Hierarchical DB's:
=================


Network DB's:
==============
Hierarchical model+many to many relationship
it is officially stated by CODASYL(Conference on data systems language)

Relational DBs
==============
MYSql
DB2(IBM)
Postgre
Oracle
H2
HSQL etc...


object Oriented DBs
===================

OOD follows all the pronciples of OOPS like class,objects,inheritance,polymorphism,encapsulation and abstraction.

main advantages of oops is reusability


What is DBMS?
===============
an application software to create,delete,update and administer data
for manipulting the data


Components of DBMS
====================
hardware=>Disk and RAM ,Keyboard,monitor etc..
software=> MySQL or Oracle
data=> information collected
procedure=>rules that help in using DBMS
DB Access Language=> Query Language to perform operations like create,read,update and delete


characters of DBMS
==================
DBMS supports ACID Properties
it stores any kind of data like images,videos,files etc,
BackUp and Recovery
Duplicate data can be reduced
sharing of data is easy
supports data security and restriction to unauthorized access

Application of DBMS
===================
Banking System
telecom
airlines
online shopping
education etc,..

Advantages of DBMS
===================
DBMS Duplicate data(data redundancy) is very less or not present
In DBMS data stored in consistent(inconsistency is removed)
we can share data among diff applications and users
we can search and fetch data from different servers
we can limit the access to the data by defining privileges or permissions
DBMS uses software locking mechanism that prevents the same set of data from being changed by 2 people at the same time
DBMS can integrate the data from diff locations
DBMS supports in quality business decisions
DBMS provide set or commands to reduce the time for acess of data by writing simple queries using this commands
DBMS restores the data to previous state in case of any crash
DBMS support tuning techniques to improve the performance
Data loss is almost eliminated
Any transaction to DBMS will be treated atomic transaction

Disadvantages
==============
Cost of hardware and software
technical staff
managing the complexity of DB
Frequent upgrade or management of data

Types of DBMS
==============
No SQL
ER Model
SQL
Document
Network
Graph database
Hierarchical DB



Normalization in DBMS
=====================
set of rules to prevent data redundancy

It is defined as process to remove to remove/redundant data among diff tables to ensure data integrity
which supplies the CRUD(Create,Read,update and delete)
it removes anamolies like
   insert anamoly
   update anamoly
   delete anamoly

SQL
====
SET of commands to manipulate the database
these set of commands are divided 4 parts

1.DDL=> create or remove and change the table in databas
==========
create
alterr
drop
truncate

2.DML=>create or remove or change values in the table
insert
update
delete

3.DCL=> to set the privilleges for accessing db
grant
revoke
4.TCL=> to commit or roll back the database transactions(create,read,update and delete) od the data in table
==========
commit
rollback
savepoint


5.DQL=>to retreive the data using select statement
==========
select 


Datatypes in MySQL
==================

Numeric: int,tiyint,smallint,mediumint,bigint,float(m,d),double(m,d),decimal(m,d),bit(m),bool,boolen

String Datatypes
===============
char(size),varchar(size),Tinytext,text,mediumtext,longtext,binary,varbinary,enum,et

BOOB(binary Larhe Object Data Types)
===================================
Tinybolb=255bytes
blob=65,635 bytes
mediumnlob=16,777,216 bytes
longblob=4gb

Date Data Type
==============
Year[(2|4)]=> 2 digit or 4 digit=> by default 4 digits are stored
DATE=>'yyyy-mm-dd'=>1000-01-01 to 9999-12-31
TIME=>'HH-MM:SS'
DATETIME=>'yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:SS'
TIMESTAMP=>'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'

constrains:
===========
2 types  column level,table level constrains

rule on data

to specify or restrict data values to store in the table

Constrains are defined on table to ensure data accuracy and integrity

Example
========

studentage cannot be=>120=>column level constraint

2 types  constrains
================
column level=> that limits to a particular column to insert particular data
table level =>that are applied on entire table that limits the data insertion on whole table


List of Constrains
================
NOTNULL
CHECK
DEFAULT
PRIMARYKEY
AUTO INCREMENT
ENUM
FORIEGN KEY
INDEX
UNIQUE


MYSQL Engines
